=============================================================================
    Directory layout:
=============================================================================
The directory structure of the project follows maven conventions.
Everything used to generate project artifacts is placed in directory "src":
    - documentation files (api, manual, html, pdf and text ...)
      in directory "src/doc"
    - code related files (sources, third party libraries and headers, ...)
      in directory "src/main"
        - for each language the sources in "src/main/<language>_..."
        - third party resources in "src/main/resources" 
        - for each document processing tool a subdir "src/site/<tool>_..."
    - test related files (description, scripts, regression files, ...)
      in directory "src/test"
Every artifact is generated in directory "build" or its sub directories 
(those names depend on the build procedures)

=============================================================================
    For Eclipse users:
=============================================================================
To install the project, you first clone the repository to 
a directory in your Eclipse workspace: e.g.
        hg clone https://bitbucket.org/lwillem/indismo3 
Alternatively you download a zip file with all project artifacts from 
the bitbucket web site and de-compress the zip file. 

Then, open Eclipse and select "New" from the "File" pull-down menu and s
elect "Makefile project with existing code" and follow instructions.
    
The project includes the conventional make targets to build, install, test
and clean the project. There is one additional target "configure" to set up
the CMake structure that will actually do all the work. Make is used as a
front to CMake. 

In Eclipse open a "Make Target" view and add the targets manually. The
targets are named "configure", "all", "install", "test" and "clean".

=============================================================================
    Macros:
=============================================================================
This text refers to a number of macros that configure the functioning of
the make/cmake build and install targets.

If you do not want the default values for the macros referred to in this
file, there are two options. You define them on the make or cmake command
line or you introduce a file named MakeLocalConfig. If such a file exists 
in this directory, make will include it, thus defining the macros. An
example MakeLocalConfig file can be found in src/main/resources/make.

If you work with cmake directly and do not want the default macro values,
you need to define them on the cmake command line.
      
Current macro and their values can be found reading this file, reading the
file DEPENDENCIES.txt explaining about the third party software that we use
and by looking at CMakeBuildConfig.txt in the src directory. 

=============================================================================
    Build and install project artifacts (application, tests, documentation):
=============================================================================
We use an out of source build of all artifacts using the cmake tool.
This requires the build directory (macro BUILD_DIR) to be
created and configured (target configure) by generating Makefiles in it.
You can define a build type (macro CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE) such as Debug or Release.
The project artifacts are installed in a directory (macro CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE).
      
The sub directories of src each involve different categories of artifacts:

    src/doc  : API documentation, license info, code analysis, ...
    src/main : app and test executables, libraries, configuration files, ...
    src/test : test definitions and resources for testing main artifacts, ...
    
There are three activities: build, install, test. While some of the unit 
tests can run without an installation, most tests depend on installed 
workspace, output directories for test reports, etc. We have opted to run
all tests post install.

The targets are listed below.

    configure     ( generate Makefiles in build dir )
    all           ( build all artifacts             )
    install       ( install all artifacts           )
    clean         ( remove entire build directory   )
    test          ( run tests / checks post install )  

The _main and _test targets are there for development work with recurring
compile-install-test cycles.

Note that all implies that _main and _test artifacts are built or installed,
but not the site artifacts. For those you need to explicitly set the macro
INDISMO_INCLUDE_DOC=ON in the make  or cmake invocation or in your
MakeLocalConfig file.
             
=============================================================================
    Build and install directly with make:
=============================================================================
We use the Makefile in the toplevel project directory to trigger cmake 
invocations. The targets have the effect described above: 
    "make all"            build all artifacts after configuring for cmake
    "make install"        installs all the artifacts
    "make test"           runs tests (and that needs to come after install)

=============================================================================
    Build and install directly with cmake:
=============================================================================
You can bypass the Makefile and directly do ( i.e. the familiar 
command line CMake procedure):
    "mkdir build; cd build"
        creates build directory named target and go to it       
    "cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/tmp/some_dir ../src" 
        generates Makefiles, defining the install directory macro        
    "make all; make install"                          
        build and install everything
        
If you want a different build type e.g. Debug, then in the third step you have
to define the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE. See the section above for the available macros.
